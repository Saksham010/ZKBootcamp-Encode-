1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
What is
a) 4 + 4
b) 3 x 5
c) what is the inverse of 3 ?

a => 8 (lies outside S)
b => 15 (lies outside S)
c => Inverse doesnot exist with given set of integers.

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

ans=> S is not closed under addition. eg: for 4 + 4 = 8 (does not belong to S) so not a group.

3. What is -13 mod 5 ?

ans => 2

4.For the polynomial
Find a the positive root ?
What is the degree of this polynomial ?
 ans=> 3
 ans=> degree = 3
